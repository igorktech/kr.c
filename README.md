## Introduction

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises from the second edition of "The C Programming Language" by K&R. Each solution is implemented in C and organized by chapter.subchapter number.

## Repository Structure

Each chapter directory contains the corresponding exercise solutions in separate `.c` files.

## How to Use

To compile and run the solutions, you need a C compiler such as `gcc`. Below are the steps to compile and run a specific exercise:

1. **Navigate to the directory** containing the exercise:

    ```sh
    cd ch1.10

    ```

2. **Compile the exercise** using `gcc`:

    ```sh
    gcc -o ex1.20 ex1.20.c
    ```

3. **Run the compiled program**:
    ```sh
    ./ex1.20
    ```

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to better understand the concepts.
